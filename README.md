I analyzed the likelihood of dying if you contract COVID-19 by comparing the total number of cases versus the total number of deaths.

By analyzing the total cases versus population, we can identify countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population. This information can be helpful in assessing the effectiveness of a country's COVID-19 response.

Additionally, by analyzing the countries with the highest death count per population, we can identify those countries that have been hit the hardest by the pandemic.

When looking at the continent with the highest death count per population, we can identify areas where the pandemic has had the greatest impact on human life.

Finally, by analyzing the relationship between population and total vaccinations, we can gain insight into the progress of global vaccination efforts and determine which countries are leading the way in vaccinating their populations.
