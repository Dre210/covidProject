I analyzed the likelihood of dying if you contract COVID-19 by comparing the total number of cases versus the total number of deaths.

By analyzing the total cases versus population, i identify countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population. This information can be helpful in assessing the effectiveness of a country's COVID-19 response.

Additionally, by analyzing the countries with the highest death count per population, i identify those countries that have been hit the hardest by the pandemic.

When looking at the continent with the highest death count per population, i identify areas where the pandemic has had the greatest impact on human life.

Finally, by analyzing the relationship between population and total vaccinations, i gain insight into the progress of global vaccination efforts and determine which countries are leading the way in vaccinating their populations.
